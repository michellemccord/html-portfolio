<h1>The Best Movies According to Michelle</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 comedy movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Free Guy</h3>
<p>Makes you laugh, cry, and gives me the urge to play sims like I did when I was younger. All around is just a great movie.</p>

<h3>Tommy Boy</h3>
<p>A hard choice between all of the amazing movies Chris Farley was in. Its just a classic.</p>

<h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
<p>Corny jokes always get me. It's a great mix of comedy and music two things I love.</p>
